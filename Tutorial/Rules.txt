Rule 1:
Comments in JavaScript ,
                     (1) Single Line Comments //
                     (2) Multi Line Comments  /* */
Rule 2 :
Unlike Golang and C , we don't specify return parameter in JS. 

Rule 3 : Hoisting
JS Function declaration is hoisted at the top of a file before the rest of JS runs.
But , Function expression is not hoisted.

Rule 4 :
Object is Referece Type in JS . They're stored on heap .
